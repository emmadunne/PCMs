# Introduction to phylogenetic comparative methods

The repo contains files associated with a 2-3 hour class on phylogenetic comparative methods suitable for a postgraduate (MSc/PhD) audience. 

Some of the materials used in this class are repurposed from a class I took led by [Dr Natalie Cooper](https://github.com/nhcooper123).
